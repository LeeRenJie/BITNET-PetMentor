The concept for this is very simple, we utilize the IMU sensor data to recognise different pet activity. Moreover we plan to build activity detection and classification for pet overall health monitoring as well with our web-application. 

<h2>Building Instructions</h2>
First of all let us gather some IMU data, for that we use data forwader of EdgeImpulse studio and write a simple program to Serial.print() x,y,x accelerometer readings. Below is the process of data acquisition.
