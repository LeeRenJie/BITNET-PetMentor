<h1>PetMentor TinyML program for automatic dog clicker</h1>

Clicker training, or mark and reward, is a form of positive reinforcement dog training. A clicker is simply a small mechanical noisemaker. The techniques are based on the science of animal learning, which says that behaviors that are rewarded are more likely to be repeated in the future. In our application, moves like sit, jump, and rollover are indicated with different lights and buzzer tones for feedback. Whenever our pet performs the desired trick, a buzzer tone is played to reinforce the behaviour, cookies and treats can also be brought into play.
